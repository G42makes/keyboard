# Keyboard From Everything
Making a keyboard from everything.

## Not from Scratch
But I will make what I can, the case, the electronics, the code and especially the keys.

The idea is to make a keyboard base, and populate the keys with ones made from multiple materials.

## Startby Testing
Starting with the excellent [Keyboard PCB Guite](https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide), I'm building the basic 4 key keyboard for testing. The thing is, I want to try using [SKiDL](https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/index.html) to design things in code instead of using KiCad. So I'll start there.
